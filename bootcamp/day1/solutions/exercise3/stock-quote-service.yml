# following stock quote API - https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/aapl/quote.  
# You can use any technology you wish.
# Tag the image and push it to DockerHub or Azure Container Service
# Deploy to K8S and test through a browser or curl
#
# Deploy the service: kubectl create -f stock-quote-service.yml
# access the service at http://ip:port/stock-quote

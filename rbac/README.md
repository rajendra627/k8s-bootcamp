# Role Based Access Control #

If you need to provide other users/roles restricted access to the K8S cluster, for example, you want "QA" roles having read/write access to only their environment, and "Dev" roles having read/write access to only their environment, then RBAC is the means to do so going forward.

**Note: AKS currently does not support RBAC. It will support RBAC when it goes GA.  As of now, to use RBAC on Azure, you need to either use ACS (Azure Container Service), a customer cluster created using acs-engine, or a custom cluster created using kubespray.**

**Note, you can also provision multiple clusters - a separate one for each environment that needs to be supported.  This is actually the simpler approach and used by many organizations.**

## Authentication and Authorization in K8S ##

K8S supports a very flexible authentication/authorization model that is extensible through plugins and modules.  There are different authentication and authorization modules to support different requirements - from simple username/password to x509 certificates to Open ID Connect with an external Identity Provider, and more.

![access-control-overview](./access-control-overview.svg)

You can configure multiple authentication modules to support different authentication scenarios within your cluster.  Each of the enabled authentication modules will be invoked and short-circuited when the first module authenticates the request.  If all the modules cannot authenticate then access is denied.

See [Controlling access to the K8S API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/accessing-the-api/) to set up HTTP Basic Auth authentication, and see [Azure Active Directory plugin for client authentication with OIDC](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/plugin/pkg/client/auth/azure) to set up authentication with your Azure AD tenant.

Below we will show setting up authentication and RBAC authorization using x509 certificates.

## Authenticating using x509 certs ##

See scripts to do this in the [certs](./certs) directory.

```sh
#1. Create credentials
openssl genrsa -out user.key 2048
openssl req -new -key user.key -out user.csr -subj "/CN=user/O=organization"
#CLUSTER_CA_LOCATION for minikube would be $HOME/.minikube
openssl x509 -req -in user.csr -CA CLUSTER_CA_LOCATION/ca.crt -CAkey CLUSTER_CA_LOCATION/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out user.crt -days 500

#2.  Create a new cluster/user context for kubectl using the user.crt/key that was just created
kubectl config set-credentials user --client-certificate=./user.crt  --client-key=./user.key
kubectl config set-context user-context --cluster=cluster --user=user

#3.  Set the current context to the user-context
kubectl config use-context user-context

#4.  Now try to do something
kubectl get pods

```

## Enabling RBAC ##

- Start up minikube with the options to enable RBAC on the api-server.

```sh
minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.Mode=RBAC

# required to get the kube-dns and dashboard pods to run
# See https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/1734
kubectl create -f minikube-rbac-privileges.yaml
```

## Finding out what you can do ##

To find what you can do:

```sh
kubectl auth can-i verb resource

#can i create pods?
kubectl auth can-i create pods

#can i create pods in the kube-system namespace
kubectl auth can-i create pods --namespace kube-system

#can i create pods in the kube-system namespace as the default systemaccount user?
kubectl auth can-i get configmaps --namespace kube-system --as system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default
```

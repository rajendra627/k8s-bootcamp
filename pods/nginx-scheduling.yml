# This pod will only be scheduled to a node with the label 'disk=ssd'
# See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/ for details

# Try to deploy this pod using 'kubectl create -f nginx-scheduling.yml'
# Get the pod details with 'kubectl get pod/nginx-example --output=yaml'
# Notice that this pod was 'Unschedulable'.  This is because there are
# no nodes with the label 'disk: ssd'.
#
# Add a label to one of your nodes with 'kubectl label node <node_name> disk=ssd'
# Then delete and create the pod again.  You will see that the pod will be scheduled.

# Extending Kubernetes #

Kubernetes is highly extensible.  Not only can you swap out the core components with your own implementations, you can build on top of the existing components to add additional capabilities to your cluster.  The community is already leveraging these capabilities to build resuable components on top of Kubernetes.  For a good example, see [Operators](https://coreos.com/operators/).
